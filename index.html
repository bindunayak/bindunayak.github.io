      <h2>Projects & Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>XiL Automation Platform</strong> – Specialized in XiL (HiL & SiL) model development, embedded systems validation, and automation 
using ECU-Test, Vector CANoe, dSPACE, and ETAS LabCar Platform.
• Developed AUTOSAR-compliant software, including SWCs, OS device drivers, RTE mappings, and 
scheduling mechanisms.
• Implemented low-level communication and signal flow diagnostics using CANoe and CAPL scripts.
• Automated complex test pipelines and regression frameworks using Jenkins, MATLAB, and Python.
• Debugged system-level issues on multiprocessor simulation platforms, ensuring real-time constraints.
• Built AI-powered Python/C++ tools for test orchestration and diagnostics, integrating ML-based 
decision support.
• Simulated host-networking behaviors for embedded control units and ensured protocol compliance.

        </li>
        <li>
         • Assisted in embedded software integration and system-level debugging with ETAS INCA, RTE 
Generator, and Toolbase.
• Performed validation of device drivers and OS layer components, focusing on safety-critical 
compliance.
• Applied DevOps practices using Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and CI/CD to support firmware delivery cycles
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI-Powered Test Automation Bot (Bosch Chatbot) :</strong> – Developed an intelligent bot using Python and C++ to automate embedded system testing integrated 
with Jenkins and MATLAB.Enabled end-to-end test orchestration, fault analysis, and diagnostics across 
XiL platforms like HiL/SiL.Reduced manual testing efforts by 70% and accelerated test cycles with 
real-time monitoring.Improved test reliability and integration with ECU-Test for automotive validation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Real-Time Heart Rate Monitoring with GPS & Cloud (IEEE Paper) :</strong> – Built a wearable device to monitor heart rate and GPS data in real time using embedded sensors.
Data was transmitted securely to Azure Cloud, enabling remote health tracking and alerting.
Simulated fault conditions to validate system resilience under real-world stress.
Focused on emergency response, ensuring reliable cloud communication and uptime
